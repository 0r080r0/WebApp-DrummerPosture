# Prototype Web Application for Drummers' Posture Correction (with ongoing Refinements)

Link to the Live App: https://0r080r0.github.io/WebApp-DrummerPosture/

This repository contains files for a **prototype web application** to give real-time visual feedback about posture while drumming.

App users will be able to use the prospective web app on their mobile phone or computer, to enhance their self-awareness about potentially bad postural habits to correct their posture. 
The purpose is to help prevent postural-related health issues in drummers.

To track movement and estimate movement angles and posture, the open-source OpenPose API is used. During the use of the app, users will see movement tracking indicators for visual feedback.
Personalised adivce for drummers' posture correction will be shown after each recorded session.
